      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        Proud To Be Us Laos (PTBUL) was founded in 2012 to advocate for the greater well-being of LGBTIQ people in Lao PDR. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our initial work focused on raising awareness of sexual reproductive health issues, in particular the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS through peer education. This remains a prominent feature of our work today, but our activities now have a broader approach aimed at ensuring that all LGBTQIA+ people are respected and included in society so that they are able to make positive contributions to their communities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, we expand scopes of work to ensure that LGBTQIA+ issues are included, adapt social attitudes and encourage society not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity through advocacy work, especially in three priority areas such as: fair and equal provision of sexual health care services, stigma and discrimination free in educational institutes, and equal employment opportunities.
      </p>

        Strengthen the abilities of the LGBTQIA+ to be empowered to showcase their capacity and positive willpower in national development affairs to the wider society.
      </p>

        Create a solid vision for the LGBTQIA+ to have the capacity to live in a quality lifestyle, be proactive, and be able to achieve their full potential in an equitable and equal environment without stigma & discrimination based on socio-economic status, physical and emotional conditions, homeland, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity & expression.
      </p>
      <h1>Purposes of Establishment</h1>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Promote and disseminate information about LGBTQIA+ for social acceptance and understanding to alleviate stigma & discrimination in order to get accessed to friendlier social services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enable positive environment for the LGBTQIA+ to obtain equal opportunities without social prejudice and possess a platform to contribute to the national development.
